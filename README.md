  This is a simple app to display a list of  recently posted articles about Node.js from HackerNews (powered by [Algolia](https://hn.algolia.com/))
  
  It uses a scheduler function to populate a MongoDB database with new posts every 60 minutes, and PUG as a template engine.

## Usage

Clone or download the repo and install de dependencies.
  
```sh
  
$ cd hacker-news

$ npm install

```

  You'll need to set up an environment variable (**MONGODB_URI**) to your MongoDB instance.
Then start the sever

```sh
npm start
```
